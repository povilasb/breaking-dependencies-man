This repository contains docs about breaking dependencies in code. These
techniques are taken from Michael C. Feathers "Working effectively with
legacy code". The docs are in restructured text which is translated to Unix
man pages.

To build manual page simply execute::

	$ make

The resulting manual pages will be built in `./build/man`.
